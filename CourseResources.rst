Me Too Ideas
........................

A *"Me Too"* idea takes a current idea in the market and often implements the idea in a way that is either better than the rest of the alternatives in the market or in a way that resolves unaddressed problems for the user. *"Me too"* ideas often take marketshare away from incumbents (existing competitors) in the market.

From "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel:

"You've probably heard about first mover advantage....but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It's sometimes better to be the last mover - that is, to make the last greatest development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits."

Compare your calculation to the one in the post on Quora once you are done. Keep in mind that different assumptions and numbers will lead you to a different result.

Nir Eyal talked about how products that start out as vitamin-like products can become painkillers (an integral part to users habits and life). These products include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

One interesting point about monetization, Facebook did not make money for some time, but the company knew the data they were collecting had value and could be monetized in the future.

“Uber for x” (kittens, watermelons, groceries) is a common phrase which makes it simple for an audience to know the startup provides on-demand services.

As Aaron Harris mentioned earlier, if you aren’t solving a problem that is close to your heart - and something you relate to - you may have trouble designing the product.

**More on Sharon Tomer's comment about predicting the future...**

  From How Google Works pp 251
  "So the question to ask isn't what will be true, but what could be true. Asking what will be true entails making a prediction, which is folly in a fast-moving world."

  "Even experts are poor predictors about highly uncertain events, as the psychologist Philip Tetlock has shown in his twenty-year study of the predictions of hundreds of experts. For example, experts were no better than the average educated person (and no better than random chance) at correctly predicting such outcomes in their field as whether apartheid would end through nonviolent means, whether Quebec would secede from Canada, and the like.
