Me Too Ideas
........................

A *"Me Too"* idea takes a current idea in the market and often implements the idea in a way that is either better than the rest of the alternatives in the market or in a way that resolves unaddressed problems for the user. *"Me too"* ideas often take marketshare away from incumbents (existing competitors) in the market.

From "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel:

"You've probably heard about first mover advantage....but moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash flows in the future, so being the first mover doesn't do you any good if someone else comes along and unseats you. It's sometimes better to be the last mover - that is, to make the last greatest development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of monopoly profits."

Evalute and Triage Ideas
..........................

`Candy, Vitamins, and Painkillers <http://brandednoise.com/2013/06/22/toothbrush-vitamins-and-pain-killers/>`_

`What is Market Sizing? <http://www.optimizationgroup.com/methods/market-sizing/>`_

`A Full Market Sizing Example <http://web.archive.org/web/20141110140211/http://www.brekiri.com/blog/193/a-full-market-sizing-example/>`_

`Test Yourself: How many piano tuners are there in Chicago? <http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-back-of-the-envelope-techniques-to-identify-the-size-a-market>`_
Compare your calculation to the one in the post on Quora once you are done. Keep in mind that different assumptions and numbers will lead you to a different result.

Nir Eyal talked about how products that start out as vitamin-like products can become painkillers (an integral part to users habits and life). These products include Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

One interesting point about monetization, Facebook did not make money for some time, but the company knew the data they were collecting had value and could be monetized in the future.

“Uber for x” (kittens, watermelons, groceries) is a common phrase which makes it simple for an audience to know the startup provides on-demand services.

As Aaron Harris mentioned earlier, if you aren’t solving a problem that is close to your heart - and something you relate to - you may have trouble designing the product.

User Research

In their book, `User and Task Analysis for Interface Design <http://www.amazon.com/User-Task-Analysis-Interface-Design/dp/0471178314>`_ , Hackos and Redish devote an entire section to the formulation of unbiased questions.

**More on Sharon Tomer's comment about predicting the future...**

  From How Google Works pp 251
  "So the question to ask isn't what will be true, but what could be true. Asking what will be true entails making a prediction, which is folly in a fast-moving world."

  "Even experts are poor predictors about highly uncertain events, as the psychologist Philip Tetlock has shown in his twenty-year study of the predictions of hundreds of experts. For example, experts were no better than the average educated person (and no better than random chance) at correctly predicting such outcomes in their field as whether apartheid would end through nonviolent means, whether Quebec would secede from Canada, and the like. See `Philip Tetlock's Expert Political Judgement: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? <http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715>`_

`Accessible Design Palettes <http://colorsafe.co/>`_

**Element Designs**

Elements should have contextual clues so that screen readers can assist users with navigation. (i.e. "Next" vs "Next 50 Emails"). Touch targets for mobile screens should be large and have enough space between other touch targets so users can tap them easily. Color contrast should meet a specific ratio. It's a standard that's been set by the `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html>`_

Purposes of Different Fidelities
................................

**Questions that are useful for each stage of prototyping:**

Low-fidelity: 

* Is each main function of the app easily accessible to users? 
* Do users easily identify what the functionality of the app is?
* What is getting in the way of their use of that functionality? 
* What expectations do they have of potential supplemental functionality for the app?

Med-fidelity:

* For each screen, does the design of the screen work to guide users to the right functions?
* Does the user easily navigate through the app to find supplemental functionality?
* Do users easily find the interaction points we intend them to?

Hi-fidelity: 

* Does the animation between each screen delight users?
* Does our use of color work to make their experience compelling?
* Do users like how the app reacts to touch gestures?

**Think Out Load**

For more info on think-aloud, take a look `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol>`_

**Cody's Interview**

Cody uses the term 'micro interactions' in this video, which we haven't defined. Essentially, a micro interaction is any very small interaction between a user and an app. 

A good example would be what happens when we check off a task. Does the task disappear? Does it slide out? Which direction does it slide? Does the task change color? What kind of check fills the checkbox?

In short, a micro interaction is one that is just a small component or feature in an app.

**Outsourcing**

This outsourcing consultation included some new vocabulary. None of it is required to understand the main point, but we've defined some terms here: 

**Palette** is a new API for Android that allows you to extract and make use of colors in an image.  Palette provides developers with a way to grab colors that will work well with images in your apps.

**Typography** is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.

**Interaction elements** are the parts of the app that a user might interact with. This is a synonym for interaction points or hotspots. 

The **feature set** of an app is the set of things an app can do for a user. Each thing an app can do is a 'feature.'

Geoffrey Moore's Final Advice on Value Positioning
.....................................................

Positioning is about where you fit in your customer's head. You need to be able to frame yourself appropriately by choosing the right category.

The right category will help you define your appropriate competitive set. Customers can refer to your competitors' products to quickly understand your product.

Using the right category and competitive set, you can then clearly differentiate value from the rest of your competition.
