Nanodegree Course Overview
**************************

The entire Nanodegree revolves around 4 core concepts:

1. Gain rapid feedback through prototyping and talking with actual people
2. Integrate your monetization mechanism into the designs of your product early on
3. Fast prototype iteration
4. Understand your customer on a deep level to guide your marketing strategies

You are not expected to actually build the product in this course. At the end of the Nanodegree program, you will come out with a well-researched pitch deck that you can use to start recruiting investors, co-founders, employees to help build the product.
