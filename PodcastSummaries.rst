There is no lesson here so this podcast is completely optional to listen to if you don’t want to hear me talk.

We’re going to give a big picture overview of what you’ve learned so far in the Nanodegree program and tell you how to think about your next steps as you dive deeper into the learning more technical information in the Nanodegree program.

By now, you should be 1.5 to 2 months in your Nanodegree program.

Here are the big things you’ve learned so far:

**Validate your Idea**

- *Verifying the market*
  - Best way to get feedback from your idea is to talk with real people
  - Talk with friends of friends
  - Don’t take feedback personally!

You can also look at your competition. If there are competitors doing the same thing you want to do then there is a demand in the market and your competitors have done the hard work to verify the market demand already.

- *Verifying your initial solution*
  - You have an idea, but you now need to see if your implementation can work.
  - Use prototype method to quickly validate your solutions
  - Get feedback and update your prototypes. Go out and test the prototype again
  - Test until you have a good user flow and user interface

**Build that Prototype**

  Paper drawings are your best friend. They allow for fast and efficient iteration

  *Exceptions:* Virtual Reality, new types of technology such as 3D printing, etc.

  You should still sketch out what you believe the interface can look like.
  Want to figure out the UX, the entire experience and not just the visual cues
  You can also make a pre-recorded video of how the new technology would work

  Ask people to do tasks with your prototype. Don’t ask them what they think.

  It’s very important you be there and see their frustrations, questions, and body language as they go through your User Experience.

**Finding Target Audience**

  It's important to build that persona. After talking with people for your prototype, you should have also asked them who they are and what they do for a living. Get to know these people in order   to build that persona.

  You need to figure out how to market to these people

  The value positioning statement is key to help you communicate your value and how different you are compared to anything else out there.

**Making Money**

  Need to understand your customer. The persona is useful to help you understand what monetization method can work for your customer. You need to build a money making mechanism that is compatible with your target audience. You need to know who these people are and how much disposable income they have.

    - Low disposable income -> Ads
    - High disposable income -> Subscription, premium, buy the software up front

  Design your money making mechanism into your app designs early on. Don’t just tack it on at a later time. This will ruin the carefully crafted experience you want to give to customers you’ve worked so hard on already. The monetization experience should be a core experience in your design.


**Business = about driving long term value for your customer.**

**Final advice:**

  Take all your steps one step at a time. Congratulations! You’ve learned the major steps it takes to build and market your product.

  Take the time now and reflect on what you need to do now for the next few months.
  So where are we?

  Congratulations if you’ve made it through this far in the course you have a solid understanding of the entire process it takes to develop your idea into a validated product.

  What’s next? You’ll be diving deep into each aspect of entrepreneurship and will develop your idea on a deeper level.

  From here on out, you’ll be diving deep into product design, prototyping, marketing, and monetization.
